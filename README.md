I present to you an essential dataset for healthcare professionals, researchers, and developers working in the field of medical image analysis. This breast cancer database consists of three distinct directories: benign, malignant, and normal.

Benign Tumor: Abnormal enlargement of a part of the body without immediate severity, with 891 image files.
Malignant Tumor: Tumor characterized by an abnormal proliferation of cells, with 421 image files.
Normal: Images of normal tissue structures, with 266 image files.
This collection of images is a valuable resource for training and testing algorithms designed to differentiate between benign and malignant cancers, as well as to identify normal tissues. It offers a comprehensive set of examples for studying various aspects of medical image analysis.

Whether you are a researcher, developer, or healthcare professional, you will find in this dataset the necessary tools to develop and evaluate new methods for automated tumor detection and classification, especially using advanced Deep Learning techniques for precise predictions.
